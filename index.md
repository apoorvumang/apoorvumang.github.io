I am a research scientist at [Adobe Research, Bangalore](https://research.adobe.com/careers/bangalore/) with a research focus on NLP and multi-modal machine learning.

I received my PhD from the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://www.iisc.ac.in/) where I was advised by [Prof. Partha Pratim Talukdar](http://talukdar.net/).

Prior to graduate school, I received my Bachelor of Engineering (BE Hons.) in Computer Science from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (BITS Pilani)](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) in 2015.


## Research

I am broadly interested in machine learning, natural language processing and related fields. In my post-graduate work, I have had a specific focus on knowledge graphs (KG) and question answering. In this area, I have tried to improve QA performance by combining pre-trained language models with KG embeddings. I have also worked on making KG embeddings more scalable and easier to apply to downstream tasks.
During my undergraduate studies I worked on humanoid robotics and computer vision.
