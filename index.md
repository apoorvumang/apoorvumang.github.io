I am a research scientist at [Adobe Research, Bangalore](https://research.adobe.com/careers/bangalore/) with a research focus on NLP and multi-modal machine learning.

Previously I received my PhD from the Department of Computational and Data Sciences (CDS) at the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://www.iisc.ac.in/). I was supervised by [Prof. Partha Pratim Talukdar](http://talukdar.net/).

Prior to graduate school, I received my Bachelor of Engineering (BE Hons.) in Computer Science from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (BITS Pilani)](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) in 2015.


## Research

I am broadly interested in generative AI (NLP, computer vision) and their applications. In my post-graduate work, I had a specific focus on knowledge graphs (KG) and question answering. In this area, I have tried to improve QA performance by combining pre-trained language models with KG embeddings. I have also worked on making KG embeddings more scalable and easier to apply to downstream tasks.
During my undergraduate studies I worked on humanoid robotics and computer vision.

## Side Projects

### 3D Printing Store: Everything 3D

I run a 3D printing store where I create custom-designed products, including personalized fridge magnets, desk signs, and more. You can explore my work and order your own unique items via the store or follow the latest creations on Instagram.

Store: [everything-3d.mini.store](https://everything-3d.mini.store/)  
Instagram: [everything_3d_india](https://www.instagram.com/everything_3d_india/)

### Podcast transcription and highlight generation

I used openai-whisper (along with pyannote and flan-t5) to automatically generate transcripts and highlights for all episodes of The Seen and The Unseen
podcast by Amit Varma. These can be browsed at [https://apoorvumang.github.io/seenunseen](https://apoorvumang.github.io/seenunseen) <br> <br>
